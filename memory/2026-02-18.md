# 2026-02-18 (Evening Session — Updated Late Night)

## Blofin Backtest Interface Fix — ✅ COMPLETE
- **Root cause**: 3 different `detect()` interfaces across strategy files. BacktestEngine calls `detect(context_candles, symbol)` but 12 strategies used old tick interface, 5 used `analyze()`, 22 files were empty.
- **Builder completed at 22:57 MST**: 35/35 strategies pass validation
  - Rewrote 8 tick-interface strategies to candle interface
  - Fixed syntax errors in momentum_v1/v2/v3/v4, rsi_divergence_v1-v5
  - Converted 5 analyze-interface strategies (strategy_023-027) with descriptive class names
  - Deleted 22 empty files, archived 22 dead registry entries
  - `bb_squeeze_v2`, `breakout_v2`, `cross_asset_correlation`, `ema_crossover`, `macd_divergence` were already correct
- **Next pipeline run should produce actual trades** and start promoting T0→T1

## Numerai Era-Boosting Experiment — IN PROGRESS
- Builder spawned (sonnet), running experiment 001
- Implementing era-boosting for LightGBM: smoke test 1K → 50K → full dataset
- Goal: reduce per-era correlation std by 20%+ (improve MMC from 0.001 → 0.01+)

## Token Usage Tracking — DEEPER INVESTIGATION
- OpenClaw's code calls `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` but the OAuth token lacks `user:profile` scope
- Direct API curl returns `permission_error: OAuth token does not meet scope requirement user:profile`
- claude.ai endpoints blocked by Cloudflare (can't curl)
- Token stored at `~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/auth-profiles.json` → `profiles.anthropic:default.token` (starts with `sk-ant-oat01-`)
- **Options presented to Rob**: (1) re-auth with broader scopes (upstream), (2) headless browser scrape of claude.ai, (3) separate API key
- Rob hasn't decided yet — waiting on his preference

## Agent Teams Documentation — ✅ COMPLETE
- Expanded `brain/AGENT_TEAMS.md` with real comparison from Blofin redesign
- TL;DR: Agent Teams for multi-file same-repo refactors, OpenClaw subagents for independent tasks

## Subagent Reliability Issue
- First spawn attempt (21:30 MST): both builders sat at 0 tokens for 1.5h, sessions cleaned up without executing
- Second spawn attempt (22:48 MST): blofin-interface-fix completed in ~8 min, numerai still at 0 tokens initially but eventually started
- Pattern: subagents may queue for extended periods during heavy Opus usage. Consider spawning during low-usage windows.

## Power Outage
- Power went off multiple times ~22:30 MST
- Machine rebooted (uptime showed 13 min at 22:46)
- All services auto-recovered (systemd)
- CPU spiked to 87°C post-reboot (thermal ramp-up + active workloads), settled back to 67°C

## Strategy Registry State (Post-Fix)
- 35 active strategies with working interfaces (down from 57 — 22 archived)
- Tier 0: ~21 strategies ready for backtesting WITH WORKING INTERFACES
- Tier 1: 8, Tier 2: ~6
- Next hourly pipeline run (:15) will be the first real test

## System Notes
- `gnome-remote-desktop.service` showing as masked/failed — cosmetic, not real issue
- Disk at 33% (146GB) — stable
- OpenAI Codex profile has 11 rate_limit errors, cooldown active
