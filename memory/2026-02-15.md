# 2026-02-15 — Blofin Strategy Evolution Overhaul

## Summary
Redesigned Blofin strategy system from manual tuning to fully automated AI-driven evolution. Removed kanban references (legacy). Built proposal for continuous strategy generation pipeline.

## Work Done
1. **Cleanup:** Removed all kanban references from README.md (service deleted previously)
2. **AI Review Execution:** 
   - Disabled 6 underperforming strategies (bb_squeeze, breakout, candle_patterns, momentum, reversal, support_resistance)
   - Tuned 2 borderline performers (rsi_divergence, vwap_reversion) via Sonnet subagent
   - Left 5 active strategies (ema_crossover, macd_divergence, rsi_divergence, volume_spike, vwap_reversion)

## New System: Strategy Evolution v2 (Proposed)

### Core Concept
- Maintain 20 active test strategies at all times
- 48-hour testing windows per strategy
- Each strategy gets up to 3 tuning attempts (Sonnet)
- If 3 adjustments fail to improve, archive it
- Opus auto-designs replacement based on failure patterns + market regime

### Lifecycle Loop
```
Every 48 hours:
1. Score all 20 strategies (Haiku)
2. Find stalled strategies (no improvement for 2+ rounds)
3. For stalled: tune (Sonnet) or archive + replace (Opus designs)
4. Log changes, failure reasons, design prompts
5. Report: "Promoted X, tuned Y, replaced Z"
```

### Key Design Points
- **Pool size:** 20 (diversity without overload)
- **Adjustment limit:** 3 per strategy
- **Improvement threshold:** +5% score increase
- **AI allocation:** Haiku (scoring), Sonnet (tuning), Opus (design only)
- **Full automation:** No human design input, only AI-generated candidates

### Database additions needed
- `strategy_lifecycle`: generation, status, adjustment_round, scores, failure_reason
- `strategy_design_history`: design_prompt, market_context, inspired_by_failure

## Open Questions for Rob
1. 48-hour window aggressive? (vs. longer periods)
2. Multi-symbol testing or per-symbol? (currently all symbols)
3. Preserve top performers permanently? (or still subject to replacement)
4. Study failed strategies for patterns?
5. Seed initial 20 with Opus design or random?

## Next Steps
- Get approval on system design
- Implement lifecycle tracking + design history DB tables
- Build the automated loop script
- Deploy as cron job
