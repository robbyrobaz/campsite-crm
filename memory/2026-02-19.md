# 2026-02-19 — Overnight Session

## HedgeEngine — Save/Load Presets ✅
- Rob requested localStorage-based preset save/restore for promo configurations
- Sonnet builder completed in ~3 min, clean build
- Features: named presets, inline save/rename/delete UI (no popups), survives refresh
- Committed, pushed, deployed to GitHub Pages
- Rob said "HedgeEngine saves look great thanks!!!"

## Blofin Pipeline — Major Bug Fix + Cleanup ✅
- **BUY/SELL normalization bug found and fixed**: strategies emit BUY/SELL but engine compared against LONG/SHORT — caused 100% win rate on everything (SL/TP logic inverted)
- All 31 strategies demoted to T0 (every pre-fix backtest was invalid)
- 22 orphan registry entries (strategy_001-022) deleted
- Strategy cleanup builder fixed 7 zero-trade strategies — root cause: `volume` column is tick count, not real trading volume. All volume-spike thresholds were impossible. Multipliers lowered to ≤0.8 to bypass until real volume data available.
- Pipeline cron ran successfully at 00:15 MST with honest metrics: 12 T0→T1 promotions, WR 66-80%, Sharpe 0.08-0.25
- **Key insight**: Pipeline smoke test uses 5000 ticks (~10 candles) — too few for strategies needing 25+ candle warm-up. May need bumping to 50K ticks.
- 45/45 tests pass, committed and pushed to main

## Numerai Era-Boosting — Fixed ✅ + Full Run In Progress
- Early stopping bug: `early_stopping=30` killed era-boost rounds after 1 tree
- Fix was already in the code (a builder wrote it before dying): `fixed_num_rounds` param in `train_lgb()`, round 0 uses early stopping, rounds 1+ use fixed tree count (clamped to min 300)
- 3 sonnet builders died silently trying to run this — had to run it directly in main session
- **Medium run results (50K rows):**
  - Mean corr: 0.00191 → 0.00786 (+312%)
  - Sharpe: 0.145 → 0.557 (+284%)
  - Feature exposure: 0.4635 → 0.1049 (-77%) — huge for MMC
  - Era std did NOT improve (went up 7.3%) — formal gate not met
- Full dataset run (2.7M rows) kicked off at ~06:51 MST, still running in background (process `clear-tidepool`)
- Committed and pushed to master

## Numerai Performance Audit (07:08 MST)
- **Submissions happening via local bot** (`multi_model_daily_bot.py`) at 6 AM MST daily — NOT pickle uploads
- Bot is NOT running as a systemd service — unclear how it's still running (maybe a surviving terminal?)
- **Performance is poor:**
  - robbyrobml: 26 rounds, mean CORR -0.0043, 27% win rate
  - robbyrob2: 13 rounds, mean CORR -0.0057, **0% win rate** (but FNC +0.0139)
  - robbyrob3: too new for resolved data
- Feb 10 submission gap — all 3 missed simultaneously (power outage?)
- Results written to PERFORMANCE.md
- Rob wants pickle uploads to Numerai compute instead of local bot — builder investigating

## Numerai Pickle Deploy (07:11 MST) — In Progress
- Rob wants models uploaded as pickles to Numerai compute (server-side predictions)
- Rob says he tried before and "they are picky on how those actually work"
- Sonnet builder researching requirements first, then attempting deploy
- Need to verify tournament is still active first

## Rob's Overnight Instructions (00:20 MST)
- "Keep fixing until they are running smooth" — both blofin and numerai
- Blofin: ✅ confirmed smooth (pipeline cron working, honest metrics)
- Numerai: ✅ era-boost fix confirmed, full run in progress

## System Health
- CPU temps 60-84°C overnight (normal)
- Disk 42% (up from 35% — numerai data files), all services active
- Git LFS backup failing (>2GB objects rejected by GitHub) — logged to incidents.md
- No critical alerts
