## Major Work Done

### Operating Files Cleanup
- Rob frustrated that Jarvis keeps forgetting processes — asked for full review
- Created `brain/CHECKLIST.md` as the single canonical operating checklist
- Adversarial review by Sonnet found: duplicate quality gate in SOUL.md, dead references to deleted files, kanban workflow repeated 3 times, zero enforcement mechanisms
- **Deleted:** JARVIS_ARCHITECTURE_v2.md (487 lines), brain/STATUS.md, brain/STANDARDS.md, brain/CONTEXT.md, 6 unused templates, 2 stale project docs, 1 stale inbox item
- **Result:** 14 files / 1,383 lines → 10 files / 795 lines
- Key insight from review: "The documentation is comprehensive but toothless. It's a wish list, not an operating system." Enforcement is self-discipline + heartbeat monitoring for now.

### Numerai Full Run Complete
- Era-boosting experiment finished (PID 430141, 21.5 min)
- Vanilla: Sharpe 0.768, corr 0.01278, 78.7% positive eras
- Era-boosted: Sharpe 0.873 (+14%), corr 0.01576 (+23%), 80.9% positive eras
- Verdict: PARTIAL — era std improvement only -8.4% (target was +20%)
- Still a solid improvement, worth deploying conditionally
- Kanban card moved to Done

### Heartbeat Improvements
- Added Kanban Board Check to HEARTBEAT.md (every heartbeat)
- Checks In Progress cards for live builders, Planned cards for available work, Review/Test for QA needed
- Caught stale blofin-fixes task (4+ hours, dead session) — cleaned up status.json

## Evening Sprint (18:10-18:22 MST) — 3 parallel builders

### Blofin Backtest Parallelized ✅
- Added `ProcessPoolExecutor` to phase2 + phase2b in `orchestration/run_pipeline.py`
- Runtime: ~20 min → ~2.5 min (8x speedup, 12 cores)
- Pipeline timer cranked from 2h to 30min
- Commit `f16b343`, 45/45 tests pass

### Numerai Daily Bot Deployed ✅
- systemd timer: `numerai-daily-bot.timer` at 13:30 UTC daily
- Runs `multi_model_daily_bot.py --once` for all 3 models
- First auto-run: 2026-02-20 06:31 MST
- Kanban card `c_222956f8e5246_19c76d8cdf9` → Done

### Master Dashboard Deployed ✅
- Flask app at port 8890, `master-dashboard.service`
- Shows: services, timers, system health, Blofin tiers, paper P&L
- Dark theme, 60s auto-refresh
- Kanban card `c_ae0c29acf6abc_19c78a01c0f` → Done

### Master Dashboard Enhanced ✅
- Added quick links bar (Blofin, Kanban, Master, HedgeEngine, Gateway)
- Added projects panel with git status + service health per project
- Commit `97b0ab0`
- OpenClaw webchat has NO configurable sidebar — master dashboard (:8890) is the hub

### Services/Ports Reference
| Port | Service |
|------|---------|
| 8787 | Claw-Kanban |
| 8888 | Blofin Dashboard |
| 8890 | Master Dashboard |
| 18789 | OpenClaw Gateway |

## Pending
- T1→T2 gate calibration after fresh backtests (gates too high: Sharpe≥0.5, EEP≥50)
- Git LFS backup still failing (non-critical)
- Numerai hyperparameter sweep (not urgent — ship first, tune later)

## Decisions
- CHECKLIST.md is the single canonical workflow — SOUL.md and AGENTS.md reference it, don't duplicate it
- PROJECTS.md = strategic overview, Kanban = live work queue — both must be updated
- Delegation decision tree added: sessions_spawn(sonnet) for code, Agent Teams for 3+ parallel, qa-sentinel for review
- Lower T1→T2 gates recommended (Sharpe≥0.15, EEP≥30) — current gates unrealistic post-fix
- Ship Numerai era-boosted model first, tune hyperparams later
