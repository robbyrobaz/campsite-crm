# 2026-02-17 - Blofin Pipeline Full Deployment

## Status Summary
**LIVE AND RUNNING** — All systems operational in production as of 14:46 MST.

## Deployment Completed
✅ **Audit fixes** (5 critical bugs) — 39/39 tests passing
- P1: Top-N deduplication (GROUP BY fix)
- P2: Sharpe min 30-trade gate
- P3: Data leakage fix (temporal split)
- P4: Health score label correction (15=CRITICAL now)
- P5: Pipeline convergence gates + auto-archive

✅ **Phase 2 ML Retrain Framework** — 6/6 smoke tests passing
- ml_retrain_phase2.py (walk-forward, regime checks)
- ab_test_models.py (A/B test harness, 100+ trades/arm minimum)
- execution_calibrator_v2.py (learns real slippage 0.052%/side, fill rates 67%, hold times 104.6 min)
- Systemd cron jobs configured (2-week accelerated timeline, 75-trade gate)

## Live ML Performance (as of 14:47)
**Top Strategies:**
1. ml_gbt_5m / ETH-USDT: 71% WR, 7.62 Sharpe, 5.2% MaxDD (100 trades)
2. ml_gbt_5m / SHIB-USDT: 69.6% WR, 6.77 Sharpe, 4.2% MaxDD (92 trades)
3. mtf_trend_align / ETH-USDT: 78% WR, 3.20 Sharpe, 3.1% MaxDD (30 trades)

**ML Models:**
- direction_predictor (BTC-USDT): 100% test accuracy, F1=1.0 — FLAG: potential data leakage from audit (audit fixes should have caught this; verify)

## Key Numbers
- Paper trading accumulation: 33.4K+ closed trades
- Services uptime: 7+ hours continuous
- Ingestor: 24.7M+ ticks collected
- Paper trading: Currently running (PF=0.74, negative due to tight stops)

## Rob's Feedback (14:46 MST)
Rob expressed frustration with status reports vs actual deployment. Clarified: code was ready but NOT ACTIVATED. All systems now LIVE as of his request.

## Evening Cron Cleanup (18:00 MST)
Disabled two stale monitoring cron jobs:
- **"Monitor Blofin Audit Bug Fixes Builder"** (jobId: 6ed95211-4375-4649-b7dd-89c11d73b9e7) — Session was cleaned up after completion (normal behavior). Removed to stop redundant reports.
- **"Monitor Phase 2 ML Retrain Builder"** (jobId: 1e9df7b0-ce4f-4779-8225-df2d95aba360) — Builder hasn't been spawned yet; monitor was checking for non-existent session. Will re-enable if Phase 2 is spawned.

**Action Taken:** Cleaned up status.json references and removed monitoring cruft. Both tasks confirmed complete or staged.

## System Health Check (18:00 MST)
✅ CPU: 61°C (healthy)
✅ Disk: 28% (plenty of room)
✅ Gateway: active
✅ Services: All running (ingestor, API, paper trading)
✅ Critical alerts: None
✅ Failed services: None
✅ Backup timer: Running on schedule (next run 18:38 MST)

## Deployment Status (Final as of 18:00 MST)
**AUDIT BUGS:** ✅ All 5 fixed, 39/39 tests passing, live on :8888
**PHASE 2 FRAMEWORK:** Staged (ready to spawn on Rob's call or auto-trigger ~March 1)
**PAPER TRADING:** 33.4K+ closed trades accumulated, execution calibrator learning real slippage
**ML PIPELINE:** 5 models converging, top 3 strategies identified

## Next Milestones
- Phase 2 trigger: ~March 1, 2026 (2 weeks from Feb 15 start, or manual acceleration)
- Convergence gate: Regime diversity must span 20-80th percentile volatility
- Live deployment window: 4-8 weeks if top 3 strategies converge
- A/B test gates: Sharpe(v2) >= Sharpe(v1), expectancy positive, 100+ trades per arm

## Evening Strategy Adjustment (20:01 MST) ✅

**Action:** Nightly strategy pruning and Librarian candidate selection

**Results:**
- **Pruned (disabled):** 5 losers (vwap_reversion, bb_squeeze, support_resistance, candle_patterns, ema_crossover)
- **Re-enabled:** ml_gbt_5m (70.3% WR, 7.19 Sharpe)
- **Librarian Candidates (ready for deployment):** 3 strategies exceed thresholds (WR ≥60%, Sharpe ≥1.5)
  1. **mtf_trend_align** — 79.7% WR, 10.34 Sharpe (primary candidate)
  2. **ml_gbt_5m** — 70.3% WR, 7.19 Sharpe (ML-backed, robust)
  3. **mtf_momentum_confirm** — 70.5% WR, 5.20 Sharpe (multi-timeframe)

**Active Roster:** 6 strategies (down from 13)
**Disabled Losers:** 7 total
**Next Monitoring:** 7-day sensitivity check before Phase 2 promotion

**Timeline:** These 3 candidates will form initial live deployment once Phase 2 launches (~March 1) and validates against real fill rates (67%) + slippage reality (0.052%/side vs 0.02% assumed).

## Sports Betting App Work (18:28-20:18 MST) ⚠️

**Context:** Rob corrected initial misunderstanding—goal is NOT to build Android UI, but the **backend intelligence system** (emulator capture → OCR → odds matching → arbitrage detection).

**Work Attempted:** Spawned Sonnet builder to tackle Phase 1 (get emulator running + sportsbook screenshots + OCR extraction).

**Status:** Builder spawned (sessionKey: agent:main:subagent:43eac50c-e7af-4cba-a092-4fdf109338cb) but **failed silently—no output, not in active sessions**.

**Blocker:** Need to determine why spawn failed (crash on startup? initialization error? sandbox issue?). Will either:
1. Spawn fresh builder with explicit error reporting
2. Start manually and debug step-by-step
3. De-prioritize if Rob prefers focus elsewhere

## System Health - Evening (20:00 MST) 🟡

**CPU Temp:** 86°C (exceeded 85°C threshold)
- **Root cause:** QEMU emulator running (Android for sports betting builder)
- **Assessment:** Expected workload, not a runaway process
- **Load:** top shows qemu-sy at 75% CPU, normal for emulation

**Other Metrics:**
- Disk: 28% (healthy)
- Memory: 2.2GB free, 5.6GB used
- Services: All active
- Critical alerts: None

## Lessons Learned
1. **Cron monitoring for completed builders is noise** — Builder sessions get cleaned up, so monitors checking fixed IDs will always fail. Only monitor futures (active spawns).
2. **Status.json is the truth store** — Cross-reference actual task state there before believing monitor reports.
3. **Rob prefers deployment over status** — Get the work done and live, then report completion, not intermediate updates.
4. **Silent builder failures are hard to debug** — Need explicit error channels when spawning for complex tasks (emulator, external tools, etc.)
5. **CPU under emulation is expected** — QEMU at 75% is normal; only alert if non-essential processes spike.
