# 2026-02-18 (Evening Session)

## Blofin Backtest Root Cause Found
- **THE bottleneck identified**: 3 different `detect()` interfaces across strategy files
  - 11 strategies use candle interface `detect(context_candles, symbol)` → WORKING (Tier 1/2)
  - 12 strategies use old tick interface `detect(symbol, price, volume, ts_ms, prices, volumes)` → BROKEN (backtester silently catches exception, 0 trades)
  - 5 strategies (strategy_023-027) use `analyze(candles, indicators)` → BROKEN
  - 22 strategy files (strategy_001-022) are completely EMPTY (0 bytes)
- BacktestEngine calls `strategy.detect(context_candles, symbol)` at line 230 — only candle-interface strategies work
- Fix: convert all to candle interface, delete empties, archive dead registry entries
- Reference implementation: `strategies/momentum.py`

## Spawned Builders (FAILED — never started)
- `blofin-interface-fix` (sonnet) — strategy interface conversion. Session died at 0 tokens.
- `numerai-era-boosting` (sonnet) — experiment 001. Session died at 0 tokens.
- Both need re-spawning next session.

## Token Usage Tracking — SOLVED
- OpenClaw already has built-in tracking: `fetchClaudeUsage()` calls `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`
- Returns `five_hour.utilization` (%) and `seven_day.utilization` with reset times
- `/status` command shows it. No patching needed.

## Agent Teams Documentation Updated
- Expanded `brain/AGENT_TEAMS.md` with real comparison from Blofin redesign
- Agent Teams: better for multi-file same-repo refactors (cross-coordination)
- OpenClaw subagents: better for independent focused tasks (cheaper, simpler, model mixing)
- On Max 5x: only cost is burning 5-hour cap faster (~3x tokens vs single agent)

## Strategy Registry State
- 57 total, 43 Tier 0 (ALL 0 trades), 8 Tier 1, ~6 Tier 2
- Top Tier 2 by EEP: ensemble_top3 (97.86), ml_random_forest_15m (97.86), mtf_momentum_confirm (76.53)
- Pipeline running hourly but stuck — no T0→T1 promotions possible until interface fix

## System Notes
- CPU spiked to 72°C during evening (Blofin pipeline + heartbeats), came back down
- Disk at 32% (142GB used)
- All services stable throughout
