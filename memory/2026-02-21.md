## Blofin volatility strategy
- Spawned builder (sonnet) to design a volatility-based strategy tailored to the ranging_low_volatility regime; instructions required VWAP mean-reversion cues with Bollinger/ATR gating while avoiding volume mean reversion patterns.
- Builder produced `blofin-stack/strategies/volatility_low_vol_vwap_bollinger.py` with the requested template (5m timeframe, VWAP/Bollinger/ATR logic, RSI gating, low-vol volatility heuristics).
- Updated status.json to mark the task as Review/Test and noted the file creation; awaiting QA review per process notes.

## 21:10 MST — Campsite CRM restored on localhost:3000
- Root cause: shell-level `PORT=8787` (and `HOST=127.0.0.1`) forced both CRM services onto the Kanban port, causing startup collisions.
- Fixes applied in repo:
  - `backend/package.json`: `start`/`dev` now pin `PORT=5000`.
  - `frontend/package.json`: `start` now runs `env -u HOST PORT=3000 react-scripts start`.
- Relaunched services detached with logs in `/tmp` and verified:
  - `GET http://localhost:5000/health` → 200 + `{\"status\":\"OK\"...}`
  - `GET http://localhost:3000/` → HTTP 200.
