## Blofin Dashboard Initial Fix (07:29-07:55 MST)

- User reported Blofin dashboard issue at `http://127.0.0.1:8780/` ("isn't loading right" / appeared frozen).
- Diagnosis: `blofin-stack-api.service` was running an older `api_server.py` process (stale in-memory code), so dashboard UI looked outdated.
- Fix applied: restarted `blofin-stack-api.service` via systemd user service.
- Verification after restart:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:8780/healthz` returned `ok`
  - `/` served updated dashboard HTML (Live Feed + coverage cards present)
  - `/api/summary` returned valid JSON.
- User was advised to hard refresh browser (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) if stale page persisted in cache.

## Blofin Websocket Fix (07:47-07:51 MST)

- Dashboard showed stale data because websocket ingestor was failing silently.
- Root cause: Blofin API rejected oversized subscribe payloads (25 symbols in one message) with error `60012 Invalid request`.
- Fix: Updated `ingestor.py` to batch subscriptions (8 symbols per request with 150ms delay).
- Restarted `blofin-stack-ingestor.service`.
- Verification: live feed resumed, ticks updating continuously.
- Committed: `892cbe6` — Fix Blofin ingestor subscribe payload by batching symbols.

## Blofin Symbol & Throttle Fixes (07:53-08:19 MST)

- User requested: throttle API calls to Blofin for backfill, remove unavailable symbols.
- Actions:
  - Removed unavailable symbols from `.env`: `FLOKI-USDT`, `BONK-USDT`, `DOGS-USDT` (not listed on Blofin).
  - Updated `historical_backfill.py`:
    - Added throttle controls: `BACKFILL_REQUEST_SLEEP_MS=400`, `BACKFILL_SYMBOL_SLEEP_MS=1000`.
    - Reduced batch size to `BACKFILL_BATCH_LIMIT=60`.
    - Fixed symbol resolution: map ws-style ids (`BTC-USDT`) to CCXT symbols (`BTC/USDT:USDT`).
    - Skip unavailable symbols gracefully.
    - Fixed market loading bug (missing `ex.load_markets()`).
    - Switched from `until` to `since` pagination for better compatibility.
- Restarted services: `blofin-stack-ingestor.service`, `blofin-stack-api.service`.
- Dashboard now shows 22 symbols (down from 25), live feed stable.
- Committed: `002fe10` — Throttle Blofin backfill requests and harden symbol handling.

## Blofin Full Cleanup (10:47-10:49 MST)

- User complaint: Blofin dashboard has "kanban stuff" on it, multiple versions of Blofin code exist, messy structure.
- Claude Code found issues with `blofin-research`.
- Full audit revealed cross-contamination:
  - **blofin-stack** contained BOTH Blofin trading code AND kanban automation code (kanban_server.py, kanban_worker.py, kanban_watchdog.py).
  - **blofin-research** was an old inactive version.
  - **blofin-dashboard** was a standalone dashboard (not running).
- Cleanup actions:
  1. Moved kanban files from `blofin-stack/` to `kanban-dashboard/`:
     - `kanban_server.py`, `kanban_worker.py`, `kanban_watchdog.py`.
  2. Created separate `kanban-dashboard/db.py` with kanban table definitions.
  3. Removed kanban tables/functions from `blofin-stack/db.py` (now Blofin-only).
  4. Deleted obsolete directories:
     - `blofin-research/`
     - `blofin-dashboard/`
  5. Disabled/removed obsolete systemd services:
     - `blofin-research.service`
     - `blofin-dashboard.service`
  6. Removed kanban health check from `blofin-stack/dashboard_health_check.py`.
- Restarted all Blofin services successfully.
- **Result**: Clean separation — `blofin-stack` is now Blofin-only, `kanban-dashboard` is separate.
- Committed: `cfe468c` — Clean up Blofin: remove kanban contamination, delete obsolete dirs.

## Blofin Architecture (Final State)

**Active Blofin Services** (on `blofin-stack`):
- `blofin-stack-ingestor.service` — websocket → sqlite (ticks + signals)
- `blofin-stack-api.service` — dashboard on `:8780`
- `blofin-stack-paper.service` — paper trading engine
- `blofin-stack-gapfill.timer` — historical backfill (every 30min)

**Database**: `/home/rob/.openclaw/workspace/blofin-stack/data/blofin_monitor.db`

**Symbols** (22 total, all verified available on Blofin):
PEPE-USDT, SHIB-USDT, WIF-USDT, BOME-USDT, MEME-USDT, NOT-USDT, ORDI-USDT, JTO-USDT, JUP-USDT, PYTH-USDT, SEI-USDT, SUI-USDT, TIA-USDT, APT-USDT, ARB-USDT, OP-USDT, INJ-USDT, RUNE-USDT, NEAR-USDT, FIL-USDT, AAVE-USDT, ETC-USDT

**Key Fixes**:
- Batched websocket subscriptions (8 symbols/batch).
- Throttled backfill requests (400ms between requests, 1s between symbols).
- Symbol validation against Blofin markets.
- Removed kanban contamination completely.
