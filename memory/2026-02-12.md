- User reported Blofin dashboard issue at `http://127.0.0.1:8780/` ("isn't loading right" / appeared frozen).
- Diagnosis: `blofin-stack-api.service` was running an older `api_server.py` process (stale in-memory code), so dashboard UI looked outdated.
- Fix applied: restarted `blofin-stack-api.service` via systemd user service.
- Verification after restart:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:8780/healthz` returned `ok`
  - `/` served updated dashboard HTML (Live Feed + coverage cards present)
  - `/api/summary` returned valid JSON.
- User was advised to hard refresh browser (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) if stale page persisted in cache.
