## Major Work Done

### Operating Files Cleanup
- Rob frustrated that Jarvis keeps forgetting processes — asked for full review
- Created `brain/CHECKLIST.md` as the single canonical operating checklist
- Adversarial review by Sonnet found: duplicate quality gate in SOUL.md, dead references to deleted files, kanban workflow repeated 3 times, zero enforcement mechanisms
- **Deleted:** JARVIS_ARCHITECTURE_v2.md (487 lines), brain/STATUS.md, brain/STANDARDS.md, brain/CONTEXT.md, 6 unused templates, 2 stale project docs, 1 stale inbox item
- **Result:** 14 files / 1,383 lines → 10 files / 795 lines
- Key insight from review: "The documentation is comprehensive but toothless. It's a wish list, not an operating system." Enforcement is self-discipline + heartbeat monitoring for now.

### Numerai Full Run Complete
- Era-boosting experiment finished (PID 430141, 21.5 min)
- Vanilla: Sharpe 0.768, corr 0.01278, 78.7% positive eras
- Era-boosted: Sharpe 0.873 (+14%), corr 0.01576 (+23%), 80.9% positive eras
- Verdict: PARTIAL — era std improvement only -8.4% (target was +20%)
- Still a solid improvement, worth deploying conditionally
- Kanban card moved to Done

### Heartbeat Improvements
- Added Kanban Board Check to HEARTBEAT.md (every heartbeat)
- Checks In Progress cards for live builders, Planned cards for available work, Review/Test for QA needed
- Caught stale blofin-fixes task (4+ hours, dead session) — cleaned up status.json

## Pending
- Numerai systemd service for daily submissions (Planned on kanban: `c_222956f8e5246_19c76d8cdf9`)
- T1→T2 gate calibration after fresh backtests
- Git LFS backup still failing (non-critical)

## Decisions
- CHECKLIST.md is the single canonical workflow — SOUL.md and AGENTS.md reference it, don't duplicate it
- PROJECTS.md = strategic overview, Kanban = live work queue — both must be updated
- Delegation decision tree added: sessions_spawn(sonnet) for code, Agent Teams for 3+ parallel, qa-sentinel for review
