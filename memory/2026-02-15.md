# 2026-02-15 - AI Workshop Final Redesign + System Alignment

## FINAL AI WORKSHOP SYSTEM (SIMPLIFIED & LIVE)

### Label System (2 labels ONLY)
- **`ai-task`** = AI's turn (queued for work)
- **`in-progress`** = AI is working on it
- **No label + open** = Your turn to review/decide
- **Closed** = Done

**No more:** feedback, needs-review, blocked (all deleted)

### Workflow (4 simple steps)
1. **Create issue** → add `ai-task` label
2. **Cron detects** within 60s → swaps to `in-progress`, spawns subagent (Sonnet, 10 min)
3. **Subagent works** → removes `in-progress`, comments with results
4. **You review** → either close issue or comment + re-add `ai-task` if changes needed

### Precheck Script (✅ Finalized)
- **Always exits 0** (no more confusing exit codes)
- Outputs JSON: `{ "actionable_issues": [...] }`
- Empty list = NO_REPLY
- Non-empty = cron routes to issue handler
- Location: `/home/rob/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/ai_workshop_precheck.py`

### Cron Job (✅ Aligned & Silent)
- **Schedule:** Every 60 seconds
- **Delivery:** `mode: "none"` (NO announcements unless work is spawned)
- **Workflow:** Gate check → pick 1 issue (priority:high first) → spawn subagent
- **Job ID:** `da39021e-7353-4dc8-93c8-964e775603ff`

### Current Issue States
- **#24** `in-progress` — Android emulator setup (real capture, no mock data)
- **#22** `in-progress` — Token auditor work
- **#21** `ai-task` — PR reviewer (queued for next run)
- **#15** no label — waiting for your decision

## Blofin Pipeline Status

### Strategy Review (Cron: 8 AM & 8 PM)
- **Just completed:** Disabled 6 underperformers (bb_squeeze, breakout, candle_patterns, momentum, reversal, support_resistance)
  - Poor scores: 9.5-12.5
  - Win rates: 28-37%
- **Spawned Sonnet specialist** to tune 2 borderline performers (rsi_divergence, vwap_reversion)
- Goal: Cut dead weight, optimize survivors

### Health Check (Hourly)
- Running every 5 minutes past the hour
- Auto-heals minor issues
- Reports only if DEGRADED/DOWN after auto-heal

## Files Updated/Confirmed
- `scripts/ai_workshop_precheck.py` — 2-label only, JSON output
- `cron/jobs.json` — final payload + silent delivery
- `AGENTS.md` — AI Workshop workflow section
- `MODEL_ROUTING_GUIDE.md` — label system documented

## System Status: ✅ PRODUCTION READY
- AI Workshop fully simplified (no confusion)
- Precheck & cron aligned (no exit code issues)
- Cron silent (no more spam)
- Blofin actively optimizing strategies
- Phase 1 exec on #24 in progress (real results expected soon)

## Next Session
- Check on #24 completion (Android emulator screenshots)
- Review Issue #21 (PR reviewer) once picked up
- Monitor Blofin strategy tuning results
- User adds issues with `ai-task` label as needed
