## Durable notes

- Restored workspace from GitHub repo `robbyrobaz/openclaw-2nd-brain` at commit `9f8e04d` (`backup: knowledge-base sync 2026-02-11T19:06:33Z`).
- Confirmed GitHub OAuth for this laptop via `gh` and authenticated as `robbyrobaz`.
- Verified `openclaw-2nd-brain` contains knowledge-base scaffold + backup scripts/runbooks, but no Blofin websocket runtime artifacts in repo history.
- Confirmed offsite full-backup restore depends on private `scripts/offsite-backup.env` (not present on this laptop), so remote backup endpoint details are currently unavailable locally.
- Rebuilt baseline Blofin websocket research monitor stack in workspace:
  - `blofin-research/ws_monitor.py`
  - `blofin-research/.env.example`
  - `blofin-research/systemd/blofin-research.service`
  - `scripts/install-blofin-research-service.sh`
  - `runbooks/blofin-restore-and-autostart.md`
  - `projects/ops-kanban-board.md`
- Installed and enabled autostart user service: `blofin-research.service` (`systemctl --user enable --now`), status active/running at setup time.
- Committed rebuild changes in git:
  - commit `a2a0520` — `restore: rebuild blofin monitor service + kanban/runbook`.
