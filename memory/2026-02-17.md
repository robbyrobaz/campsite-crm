# 2026-02-17 - Blofin Pipeline Full Deployment

## Status Summary
**LIVE AND RUNNING** — All systems operational in production as of 14:46 MST.

## Deployment Completed
✅ **Audit fixes** (5 critical bugs) — 39/39 tests passing
- P1: Top-N deduplication (GROUP BY fix)
- P2: Sharpe min 30-trade gate
- P3: Data leakage fix (temporal split)
- P4: Health score label correction (15=CRITICAL now)
- P5: Pipeline convergence gates + auto-archive

✅ **Phase 2 ML Retrain Framework** — 6/6 smoke tests passing
- ml_retrain_phase2.py (walk-forward, regime checks)
- ab_test_models.py (A/B test harness, 100+ trades/arm minimum)
- execution_calibrator_v2.py (learns real slippage 0.052%/side, fill rates 67%, hold times 104.6 min)
- Systemd cron jobs configured (2-week accelerated timeline, 75-trade gate)

## Live ML Performance (as of 14:47)
**Top Strategies:**
1. ml_gbt_5m / ETH-USDT: 71% WR, 7.62 Sharpe, 5.2% MaxDD (100 trades)
2. ml_gbt_5m / SHIB-USDT: 69.6% WR, 6.77 Sharpe, 4.2% MaxDD (92 trades)
3. mtf_trend_align / ETH-USDT: 78% WR, 3.20 Sharpe, 3.1% MaxDD (30 trades)

**ML Models:**
- direction_predictor (BTC-USDT): 100% test accuracy, F1=1.0 — FLAG: potential data leakage from audit (audit fixes should have caught this; verify)

## Key Numbers
- Paper trading accumulation: 33.4K+ closed trades
- Services uptime: 7+ hours continuous
- Ingestor: 24.7M+ ticks collected
- Paper trading: Currently running (PF=0.74, negative due to tight stops)

## Rob's Feedback (14:46 MST)
Rob expressed frustration with status reports vs actual deployment. Clarified: code was ready but NOT ACTIVATED. All systems now LIVE as of his request.

## Next Milestones
- Phase 2 trigger: 2 weeks elapsed + 75 closed trades
- Convergence gate: Regime diversity must span 20-80th percentile volatility
- Live deployment window: 4-8 weeks if top 3 strategies converge
- A/B test gates: Sharpe(v2) >= Sharpe(v1), expectancy positive, 100+ trades per arm
