# 2026-02-19 — Overnight Session

## HedgeEngine — Save/Load Presets ✅
- Rob requested localStorage-based preset save/restore for promo configurations
- Sonnet builder completed in ~3 min, clean build
- Features: named presets, inline save/rename/delete UI (no popups), survives refresh
- Committed, pushed, deployed to GitHub Pages
- Rob said "HedgeEngine saves look great thanks!!!"

## Blofin Pipeline — Major Bug Fix + Cleanup ✅
- **BUY/SELL normalization bug found and fixed**: strategies emit BUY/SELL but engine compared against LONG/SHORT — caused 100% win rate on everything (SL/TP logic inverted)
- All 31 strategies demoted to T0 (every pre-fix backtest was invalid)
- 22 orphan registry entries (strategy_001-022) deleted
- Strategy cleanup builder fixed 7 zero-trade strategies — root cause: `volume` column is tick count, not real trading volume. All volume-spike thresholds were impossible. Multipliers lowered to ≤0.8 to bypass until real volume data available.
- Pipeline cron ran successfully at 00:15 MST with honest metrics: 12 T0→T1 promotions, WR 66-80%, Sharpe 0.08-0.25
- **Key insight**: Pipeline smoke test uses 5000 ticks (~10 candles) — too few for strategies needing 25+ candle warm-up. May need bumping to 50K ticks.
- 45/45 tests pass, committed and pushed to main

## Numerai Era-Boosting — Bug Found, Fix In Progress
- 50K row experiment completed — found early stopping bug: LightGBM's `early_stopping=30` kills era-boost rounds after 1 tree (reweighted training distribution causes validation RMSE to spike)
- Fix needed: disable early stopping for era-boost rounds or set minimum tree count
- Builder has been respawned twice (keeps dying mid-training) — v2 spawned at ~00:45 MST
- Not yet resolved as of compaction

## Rob's Overnight Instructions (00:20 MST)
- "Keep fixing until they are running smooth" — both blofin and numerai
- Blofin: ✅ confirmed smooth (pipeline cron working, honest metrics)
- Numerai: still iterating on era-boost fix

## System Health
- CPU temps 70-84°C overnight (normal)
- Disk 35%, all services active
- No critical alerts
