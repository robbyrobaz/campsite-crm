## Blofin volatility strategy
- Spawned builder (sonnet) to design a volatility-based strategy tailored to the ranging_low_volatility regime; instructions required VWAP mean-reversion cues with Bollinger/ATR gating while avoiding volume mean reversion patterns.
- Builder produced `blofin-stack/strategies/volatility_low_vol_vwap_bollinger.py` with the requested template (5m timeframe, VWAP/Bollinger/ATR logic, RSI gating, low-vol volatility heuristics).
- Updated status.json to mark the task as Review/Test and noted the file creation; awaiting QA review per process notes.
