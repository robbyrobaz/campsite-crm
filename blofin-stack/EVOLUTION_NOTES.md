### Strategy Performance (Closed Trades as of 2026-02-12)
| Strategy | Trades | Win Rate | Avg PnL% | Total PnL% |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| rsi_divergence | 20 | 45.0% | +0.12% | +2.35% |
| vwap_reversion | 38 | 31.6% | -0.23% | -8.75% |
| bb_squeeze | 49 | 20.4% | -0.55% | -26.74% |
| breakout | 272 | 31.2% | -0.25% | -67.45% |
| momentum | 701 | 35.7% | -0.14% | -97.24% |
| reversal | 2329 | 39.2% | -0.04% | -97.85% |

### Key Observations
1. **Only RSI divergence is profitable** — but tiny sample size (20 trades)
2. **All other strategies are net negative** — signals fire too aggressively
3. **Reversal dominates signal count** (70%) but has mediocre win rate
4. **BB squeeze has worst win rate** (20.4%) — needs rethinking
5. **Momentum and breakout** have decent trade counts but lose money consistently

### What This Tells Us
- The system generates signals aggressively but lacks filtering
- No position sizing or risk management
- No market regime awareness (trending vs ranging)
- Strategies don't adapt to current conditions
- Need: confirmation layers, dynamic thresholds, regime detection

### Architecture Before Evolution
```
ingestor.py — monolithic, all 6 strategies hardcoded
  ↓ signals table
paper_engine.py — confirms + trades all signals equally
  ↓ paper_trades table  
api_server.py — dashboard display
```

### What We're Building
```
strategies/           — plugin folder, one file per strategy
strategy_manager.py   — loads, scores, enables/disables strategies
knowledge_base.py     — tracks performance, stores lessons learned
ai_review.py          — periodic AI analysis of KB → strategy adjustments
ingestor.py           — calls strategy_manager instead of hardcoded logic
paper_engine.py       — confidence-weighted position sizing
```
