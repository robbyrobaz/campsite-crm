# 2026-02-15 - AI Workshop Label-Based Workflow & Issue #24 Real Emulator Setup

## Major Changes

### 1. Workflow Redesign (by Claude Code)
**Old system (broken):** Used `//` prefix in comments to signal feedback
**New system (active):** Uses GitHub labels (`feedback`, `in-progress`, `needs-review`)

**Label Lifecycle:**
- User adds comment with plain-text instructions + `feedback` label
- Precheck detects `feedback` label within 60s
- Cron spawns Sonnet subagent to execute instructions
- Agent removes `feedback` label, posts results
- If issue goes to review: `in-progress` → `needs-review`

**User can now give feedback:** Just comment + add label. No special formatting required.

### 2. Precheck Script Fixed
- Changed exit code logic: now always exits 0 with JSON output
- JSON contains `has_work` field (true/false) instead of relying on exit codes
- Detects: feedback label (priority 1), new ai-task issues, updated ai-task issues
- Script location: `/home/rob/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/ai_workshop_precheck.py`

### 3. Cron Job Updated
- Changed schedule from 5 min → **60 seconds** (frequent feedback detection)
- Updated payload to handle new label-based workflow
- Properly reads JSON from precheck, routes to feedback handler first
- Job ID: `da39021e-7353-4dc8-93c8-964e775603ff`

### 4. Issue #24 (Sports Betting App)
- Removed `in-progress` label (was blocking precheck)
- Added feedback comment with real Android emulator requirement (no mock data)
- Spawned Sonnet subagent to execute real setup (10 min timebox)
- Next step: Real Android SDK + AVD emulator + actual sportsbook screenshots

## API Keys Status
- **CONFIRMED:** Only Claude auth needed (via OpenClaw/Anthropic)
- No external API keys required (OpenAI, Google, Voyage) — these are optional, not needed
- Memory search can be enabled later if needed, but not blocking

## System Status
✅ AI Workshop automation live and responsive
✅ Cron checking every 60 seconds for feedback labels
✅ Precheck script working correctly
✅ Label-based routing system in place

## Next Session Notes
- Watch for Issue #24 subagent completion (real screenshots expected)
- New feedback workflow is active — can comment + label to trigger work
- Monitor Blofin health checks (running hourly)
- Token audit cron runs weekly (Sunday 8 AM)
