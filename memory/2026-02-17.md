# 2026-02-17 — Blofin Feedback Loop & Ranking Overhaul

## Session Work

### 1. Strategy Ranking Metrics (Research Complete)
**Problem:** Win rate alone is misleading. A 40% win rate with big winners beats 70% with small winners.

**Solution:** Composite Entry+Exit Package Score (EEP)
- **Entry metrics (60%):** 30% Profit Factor + 25% Sharpe + 20% Max DD + 15% Sortino + 10% Expectancy
- **Exit metrics (40%):** % of max profit captured (MPC), R:R realization, stop-hit frequency (SHF), breakeven stop utilization (BEUR)
- **Hard gates:** PF ≥ 1.3, Sharpe ≥ 0.8, MDD ≤ 35%, Trades ≥ 30, positive expectancy

Replaced win-rate-only ranking with this system. Now integrated into optimizer.

### 2. Exit Strategy Impact (Research Complete)
**Key insight:** Exits are as important as entries. A brilliant entry with poor exit = loss. A mediocre entry with disciplined exit = profit.

Example: NVDA trailing stop at 10% captured +21.5%, but 20% trailing stop captured only +8% — 2.7x difference on identical entry.

**Critical metrics:**
- MPC (% of max profit captured): >65% is good
- SHF (stop hit frequency): <20% means stops not being hunted
- BEUR (breakeven stop usage): >70% eliminates "win-that-became-loss" trades

### 3. Paper Trading Feedback Loop (2-Phase Approach)
**Phase 1 (Now - Immediate):** Execution Calibrator
- Learns actual slippage, fill rates, hold times from closed paper trades
- Zero look-ahead bias (closed trades only)
- Updates position sizing dynamically

**Phase 2 (After 2 weeks + 75 trades):** ML Retrain with Safety Gates
- Regime diversity check (volatility percentile must span 20th-80th range)
- A/B test minimum 100 trades per arm before accepting new model
- Conservative 1.5-2x slippage multiplier until 6 weeks of data

**Why 2 weeks not 4:** Rob's call to accelerate. Validated by Opus reviewer with guardrails above.

### 4. Reality Gap: Paper Trading Revelations
From 33,444 closed paper trades:
- **Actual slippage:** 0.052%/side (vs 0.02% assumed) = 2.6x worse
- **Stop-hit frequency:** 47.2% of stops hit, then price reversed back (stops placed at obvious levels)
- **Average hold time:** 104.6 min (vs 60 min assumed)
- **Fill rate:** 67% (not 100%)
- **Overall paper PnL:** Unprofitable (PF=0.74)

**Actionable:** Stops too tight. Increase SL by 10-75bps to avoid algo stop-hunting.

### 5. Top 3 Strategies Ready
From optimizer run (Feb 16 23:34):
1. **mtf_trend_align / SHIB-USDT [5m/1h]** — 81.8% WR, 16.74 Sharpe, +9.76% PnL
2. **ml_gbt_5m / ETH-USDT [5m]** — 71.0% WR, 7.62 Sharpe, +42.3% PnL
3. **mtf_momentum_confirm / JUP-USDT [15m/4h]** — 76.9% WR, 8.56 Sharpe, +29.28% PnL

These are what Phase 2 (2-week paper) should focus on validating. Once proven, can slow research down significantly.

### 6. Dashboard Fix
**Problem:** Dashboard showing stale library backtest data (negative PnL strategies).

**Root cause:** Optimizer saved results to JSON but API read from old database tables.

**Fix:** 
- Created sync process (sync_optimizer_to_db.py) to read latest optimizer_results_*.json and write to DB
- Dashboard now shows correct winning strategies
- API endpoints return optimizer results with source field

**Secondary fix:** Dashboard was using 599% CPU due to no caching. Added TTL-based cache (5-30s) to all endpoints. Now running at 103% CPU.

## Key Decisions
1. **Accelerate Phase 2:** 2 weeks instead of 4, with safety gates
2. **EEP scoring:** Replace win rate with composite metric system-wide
3. **Top 3 focus:** Once proven in 2-week paper trading, research drops to maintenance mode
4. **Conservative early:** Use 1.5-2x slippage multiplier and position size caps until 6+ weeks of paper data

## Next Steps
- Monitor Phase 1 execution calibrator learning from new paper trades
- At 2-week + 75-trade mark, trigger Phase 2 (ML retrain + A/B test)
- Watch for regime diversity gate (don't retrain if only one vol regime observed)
- Track actual vs backtest slippage convergence

## Memory Note
The paper trading reality gap is the single biggest actionable signal. Strategies profitable on backtest but unprofitable on paper means friction model (stops, slippage) not execution quality. Fix that before scaling capital.
