## Sports Betting App Status Confirmed ✅

**What:** Rob asked about sports betting setup. Confirmed app is FULLY OPERATIONAL (Phase 2 pipeline).

**Status (06:35 MST):**
- Real odds pipeline running on Bovada + DraftKings APIs
- Android emulator (pixel7_promo, Android 14) boots successfully
- OCR processing working on real emulator screenshots
- Arbitrage detection scanning live NFL/NBA games
- Last scan: 11 NBA games, 0 true arbs, 2 near-arbs

**Key paths:**
- Main code: `/home/rob/.openclaw/workspace/ai-workshop/projects/sports-betting/phase2-real-apps/`
- Latest odds: `odds_nba_final.json`, `odds_nhl_final.json`
- Latest arb scan: `arb_nba_final.json`
- README + BLOCKERS.md documenting full pipeline

**Known blocker (documented):**
- Play Integrity API prevents real sportsbook app installs on emulator
- Workaround: Uses public sportsbook APIs (Bovada, DraftKings ESPN) instead
- Same data accuracy, no app dependency

**To run fresh scan:**
```bash
cd ~/ai-workshop/projects/sports-betting/phase2-real-apps/
python3 pipeline.py --sport nba --stake 100
```

**Built 3x (as Rob mentioned):** Phase 1 proof-of-concept → Phase 2 real pipeline (with odds fetching) → Phase 2-real-apps (multi-book arbitrage detection).
