# 2026-02-22 — Daily Log

## Infrastructure Migration (Done)
- All 4 cron jobs verified on Anthropic models (haiku/sonnet)
- Kanban defaults changed from codex → claude (sonnet); 42 cards reassigned
- Rate limit incident ~7:30 PM MST; recovered ~9:20 PM

## Blofin Gate+PnL Ranking (Done)
- Replaced EEP scoring with gate+PnL ranking system
- Gate thresholds: backtest trades≥50, PF≥1.2, MDD<50%, PnL>0%; forward trades≥20, PF≥1.1
- 11 strategies pass gates. Top: volume_mean_reversion (25%), ml_gbt_5m (19.9%), vwap_reversion (18.9%)
- Columns added to DB: `gate_status`, `gate_failures`, `pnl_rank`
- PF threshold 1.2 not 1.5 — at 1.5 only 2 pass; crypto compresses PF

## Blofin Per-Coin Tracking (Done)
- `strategy_coin_eligibility` table created, backfilled from 77K trades
- Per-coin backtesting infra shipped but only 15×5=75 entries populated
- Bottleneck: `SCREENING_SYMBOLS` in `orchestration/run_pipeline.py` line 49 hardcoded to BTC/ETH — needs expansion to all 24 coins

## Dashboard EEP→Gate Replacement (In Progress ~10:28 PM)
- Card view updated: shows PnL%, Gates (✓/✗), Rank, PF instead of EEP Score
- Table view partially done — remaining EEP refs at lines 872, 903, 950-951, 964
- Need to replace `td-eep`/`eepLabel` with gate_status + pnl_rank columns
- Review agent only did code review, not functional testing — missed that dashboard still showed EEP

## PHASE 8 Proactive Improvements
- Added to dispatch cron with 3 gates: inbox+planned ≤ 2, CPU < 50%, 5h tokens < 60%
- Auto-creates 1-3 specific improvement cards for blofin-stack

## Other Work
- Google Cloud project `campsite-crm-app` created; OAuth consent screen set up; Gmail+People API enabled
- Gmail OAuth subagent delegated (Sonnet) — re-kicked after rate limit recovery
- ninja_trader_strategies repo cloned for ML pattern porting
- ML exploration engine card created; continuous ML automation planned
- Tradovate/prop firm research cards created — Lucid does NOT allow Tradovate API (personal only)
- TradersPost+TradeStation research card created as alternative
- Deploy hook added to kanban server `handleReviewComplete` — auto-builds + restarts on card completion
- arb-dashboard deployed via gh-pages; HedgeEnginePro risk-free bet math fix + 3-way toggle cards created

## Key Lesson
- Review agents must do functional/visual testing, not just code review — REVIEW_PASSED was issued without verifying dashboard rendered correctly
