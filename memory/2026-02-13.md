# 2026-02-13 - Dad Jokes → Video Pipeline Project Launch

## Overview
Started new AI-powered content monetization project: generate dad jokes → create videos → post to social media for passive income. 3-phase pipeline with revenue targets of $3-15K/month.

## Phase 1: Complete ✅
- **GitHub Issue #14:** "Build AI Dad Jokes → Video → Social Media Pipeline"
- Generated 92 funny dad jokes, stored in `jokes.db` (SQLite)
- Created video generation research comparing 7 AI tools (Grok, Gemini, Runway, etc.)
- Cost analysis: Grok/Gemini free (browser), fallback DIY FFmpeg ~$0.005/video

## Phase 2: In Progress 🔄
- Identified **Sleep Science** as best niche (200-290K searches/mo, $5-15K revenue potential)
- **GitHub Issue #15:** Social media research complete with affiliate strategy
  - Top products: Sleep masks, weighted blankets, cooling pillows, mattress toppers (12-20% commissions)
  - TikTok Shop integration = higher conversion vs external links
  - Content formula: Problem → Science explanation → Product solution
- User tested Grok successfully with 2 sample videos (proven the concept works)

## Critical User Feedback (18:31)
**Rob emphasized:** "I want AI to do more for me, not give me more tasks"
- He's right: browser automation exists, should use it
- Grok likely has auth/anti-bot protections (tricky to fully automate)
- **Better approach:** Build local dashboard where Rob clicks once → video generates → AI handles everything else
  - Proposed workflow: Rob spends 30 seconds clicking "generate", AI automatically handles TikTok posting, affiliate links, tracking

## Next Steps
1. Propose **Option 1** (local dashboard + auto-downstream) to Rob
2. If approved: Build UI for queuing jokes + auto-posting to TikTok Shop + conversion tracking
3. Consider **Option 2** (check if xAI has API) or **Option 3** (use RunwayML/HeyGen API for full automation)

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Jokes DB (SQLite)
- Video: Grok (manual) or API alternative
- Backend: TikTok Shop affiliate automation, posting, tracking
- Cron: Daily video generation reminders + auto-post scheduling

## Revenue Model
Sleep Science focus:
- Target: 1-2 videos daily → 365 videos/year
- TikTok Shop affiliates: $50-500 per video (10-25% commission)
- Potential: $3-15K/month with organic growth to 50K+ followers

## Status
- Issues #14 & #15 `in-progress`/`needs-review`
- Awaiting Rob's decision: Build dashboard + auto-posting, or continue manual approach?
