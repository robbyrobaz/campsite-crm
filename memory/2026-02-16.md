# 2026-02-16 — Blofin AI Pipeline LIVE

## Status: ✅ DEPLOYED & RUNNING

**Smoke Test Result:** All systems GO ✅

Ran complete smoke test with 1000 rows of data:
- ✅ Feature Manager working (95 features available)
- ✅ Backtester Engine working (1000 ticks aggregated)
- ✅ ML Pipeline ready (5 models, dependencies installed)
- ✅ Database schema correct (all tables present)
- ✅ Orchestration ready (Ranker, Reporter, Designer, Tuner)
- ✅ Systemd timer active and armed

**First run:** Tonight at midnight UTC (00:02 MST, 2 minutes from now)

## Timeline

- **Now (00:00 MST):** System deployed and verified
- **00:02 MST (tonight):** First automated pipeline execution
- **02:30 MST:** Expected completion
- **Daily thereafter:** Runs at midnight UTC automatically

## Pipeline Flow (Every 24 Hours)

```
Score all 20 strategies + 5 models (Haiku)
    ↓
[PARALLEL]:
  - Design new strategies (Opus)
  - Tune underperformers (Sonnet)
  - Train 5 ML models (Sonnet)
    ↓
Backtest new strategies
    ↓
Rank & update pools (keep top 20/5/3)
    ↓
Generate daily report (human + AI)
    ↓
Opus AI review (next day focus)
```

## What We Have

**Fully Built & Deployed:**
1. Feature Library (50+ technical indicators)
2. Backtester (multi-timeframe historical replay)
3. ML Pipeline (5 specialized models)
4. Orchestration (daily coordinator)
5. Integration (all components stitched together)

**27/27 tests passing**  
**All dependencies installed**  
**Systemd timer active**  
**Database ready**  

## Cost

**Monthly:** $100 (Claude Max 5x plan)
**Cost per day:** $0 (included)
**Cost per pipeline run:** $0 (included)

## Success Metrics

After 4 weeks of daily runs, we should see:
- 20 active strategies continuously rotating
- 5+ ML models with >55% accuracy
- 3+ ensembles beating individual models
- 200+ strategy candidates tested (~90% archived)
- Top 3 strategies ready for live money

## Research Timeline

- **Week 1:** Verify daily execution, backtest quality
- **Week 2-4:** Continuous evolution, strategy/model selection
- **Month 2-3:** Keep running until confident
- **Day 1 of Month 3+:** Deploy top 3 strategies live

## Risks Addressed

- ✅ Backtest-first (validate before live)
- ✅ No manual design (fully automated)
- ✅ No hard thresholds (dynamic ranking)
- ✅ Cost included (no marginal cost)
- ✅ Fault tolerance (error handling built in)
- ✅ Logging & monitoring (debug-ready)

## What Happens Next

In ~2 minutes, the system will automatically:
1. Load 7 days of historical data
2. Score existing strategies
3. Design 2-3 new strategy candidates
4. Backtest everything
5. Train 5 ML models
6. Create report
7. Archive results to database

This will repeat every 24 hours, forever, until we deploy top 3 strategies live.

## Files Ready

- `SMOKE_TEST_REPORT.md` — What we just verified
- `data/pipeline.log` — Daily execution log (starting now)
- `data/reports/` — Daily JSON reports (starting at midnight)
- `blofin-stack-daily.timer` — Systemd automation (active)

## Next Check-in

After first automated run (02:30 MST), review:
- `data/pipeline.log` for any errors
- `data/reports/2026-02-16.json` for output format
- Database for recorded results

System is production-ready and will now run autonomously.
